// Polymorphism : Objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

/* Different Types of polymorphisim
 1) Subtype : aka inheritance or implementation polymorphism 
 2) Parametric : aka Generics
 3) Adhoc : aka function overloading or operator overloading

Realtime use case of Polymorphisim: Express Js

Implementation example can be used as same used in Abstraction.

Advantages of Polymorphisim
 1) Code Reusability.
 2) Interface consistency
 3) Flexibility & Scalability.
 4) Reduced complexity and Enhanced collaboration
